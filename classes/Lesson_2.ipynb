Others prefer a \"camel case\" notation, such as shippingWeight to separate parts of the name.  NEVER use uppercase for every letter in a variable name, because uppercase names are reserved for final (constant) variables."

    "4. The `speed()` method accepts an `int` parameter called `maxSpeed` - we will use this in `8.`\n",
    "5. In order to use the `Car` class and its methods, we need to create an object of the `Car` Class.\n",
    "6. Then, go to the `main()` method, which you know by now is a built-in Java method that runs your program (any code inside main is executed).\n",
    "7. By using the `new` keyword we created a `Car` object with the name `myCar`.\n",
    "8. Then, we call the `fullThrottle()` and `speed()` methods on the `myCar` object, and run the program using the name of the object (`myCar`), followed by a dot (`.`), followed by the name of the method (`fullThrottle()`; and `speed(200)`;). Notice that we add an int parameter of 200 inside the speed() method.\n",
