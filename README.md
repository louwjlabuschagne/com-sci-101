# Com Sci 101

So you're taking com-sci-101 but you've never programmed in Java... 

This repo is for you... 

## Motivation

You've decided you go and study programming, but you've never programmed. First of, good choice! Programming can assist in so many facets of our daily lives and all the more it is becoming integrated into everyday appliances. From fridges to cars, to our TVs - nowadays there are programming interfaces into all these appliances. 

Why does this matter to you? Well, even if you become a chef, don't you think your restaurant can benefit from a small little program monitoring the stock and temperature of your fridge. That way you can plan for the groceries you'll need ahead of time making your entire operation more streamlined and efficient. 

The chef example is just one situation where having a basic understanding of programming can allow you to write (usually copy and paste most of the code from a tutorial somewhere) a simple program to automate everyday mundane tasks. 

## Content

For teaching purposes we'll be using Jupyter Notebooks with a Java kernel running - you can look at <a href='https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava#install-pre-built-binary'>this</a> repo to install the Java kernel for Jupyter Notebooks.
